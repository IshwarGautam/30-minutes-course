Python programming language is a high level programming language and it is very easy to use for beginner and it reduces the spaces as compared to other programming languages.
We can use many IDE: jupyter notebook, sublime text, pycharm, visual studio code, Atom etc.

To setup jupyter notebook:
1. Download python in your system
https://www.python.org/downloads/
(when you install python, you can get python IDLE and pip; using that pip you can install jupyter notebook in your system)
2. open command prompt and type pip install jupyter
3. To open jupyter notebook: type jupyter notebook 
(you can change the path like d drive, e drive and particular folder to open jupyter notebook. )
Note: if you open jupyter notebook in e drive, you are not allowed to open any file from other drive like d drive.
And if you open jupyter notebook in particular folder, you are allowed to open file that are in that folder only. 

In jupyter notebook, you can write notes and also you can do code, so it is a good IDE to write code.




Machine learning is very interesting course because we know how human can learn but we may not know how machine can learn.
The topics covered in this course (in video) are:
1. What is machine learning?
2. Types of machine learning: Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning and Reinforcement learning
3. Classes of supervised learning: Classification and Regression
4. Machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN (K-nearest neighbor) and SVM (Support vector machine).
5. Implementing theoretical concept of linear regression into program
